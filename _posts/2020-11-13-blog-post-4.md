Recently some people asked me how to get the parameters of OPLS-AA force field and set up a MD simulation for LAMMPS, here's a brief tutorial using an example of 10 ns NVT simulation of the system containing 1 solute (R) and 200 methanol solvent molecules. If you have other questions after reading the post, please let me know and I can add more details. 

### Step 1. Get the pdb files and associated parameters from LigPargen

First, generate a pdb file of each molecule you want to add in the MD simulation, here in this tutorial is [R.pdb](https://github.com/longkunxuluke/ordered_solvent/blob/master/files/R.pdb) and [MeOH.pdb](https://github.com/longkunxuluke/ordered_solvent/blob/master/files/MeOH.pdb).

Go to [LigPargen server](http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/), clicking "choose file", and read the above pdb file, then click "submit molecule", there would be many files for many different MD softwares available, download the GRO, TOP files of GROMACS and the LAMMPS file. If you get errors from LigPargen, you can try using mol files, or you can try SMILE code, for generating SMILE code, you can check this [page](http://www.cheminfo.org/flavor/malaria/Utilities/SMILES_generator___checker/index.html).

### Step 2. Change the formats of the parameters 

To use the parameters obtained from LigPargen server with fftool we will introduce below, we need to modify the formats of the parameters. [convertLigParGen.py](https://github.com/mccg-pas/group-wiki/tree/master/Scripts/ILMD) is a script written by [Michael Robinson](https://mccg.erc.monash.edu/group-members/) for this purpose. Following the information writtin by him, you can easily get the [R.ff](https://github.com/longkunxuluke/ordered_solvent/blob/master/files/R.ff) and [MeOH.ff](https://github.com/longkunxuluke/ordered_solvent/blob/master/files/MeOH.ff).

### Step 3. Produce the input files using fftool

For the details about using fftool to generate LAMMPS input file and data file, you can check this [fftool](https://github.com/agiliopadua/fftool) page of Prof. Agilio Padua, which contains very detailed information. If you want to use the polarizable force field, you could also check the tutorial of the [pol_il](https://github.com/kateryna-goloviznina/pol_il) page. Note that the [packmol](http://m3g.iqm.unicamp.br/packmol/home.shtml) program will be used to get an initial system. If you want to know mode details about using packmol, for example, if you want to place one type of molecules in a certain part of the simulation box, you can check this [tutorial](http://sobereva.com/473) written by Dr. Tian Lu. After this step, you should be able to get the [data.lmp](https://github.com/longkunxuluke/ordered_solvent/blob/master/files/data.lmp) and [in.lmp](https://github.com/longkunxuluke/ordered_solvent/blob/master/files/in.lmp). For simulations with polarizable force field, there are extra files needed, I will write more information if anyone is interested in this. 

### Step 4. Tweak the information of the in.lmp

Techniqually after Step 3, you should be able to submit the simulation. But speficically for my research, I usually need to add electric field information in. I write a simple script for this, see [crin.py](https://github.com/longkunxuluke/ordered_solvent/blob/master/crin.py). To use it, you just need to ```python3 crin.py``` and provide your job name, the strength of the external electric field and the job type. You need to put the four [template files](https://github.com/longkunxuluke/ordered_solvent/tree/master/files/template) into your local directory like ```/scratch/x69/lx3539/file/``` in my script. If you can help improve the script or/and add more functions into the script, I am very happy to hear your feedbacks.
