Recently some people asked me how to get the parameters of OPLS-AA force field and set up a MD simulation for LAMMPS, here's a brief tutorial. If you have other questions after reading the post, please let me know and I can add more details. 

First, geenrate a pdb file of the molecule you want to add in the MD simulation, for example, methanol and get the get the files in [LigPargen server](http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/). "choose file" and choose the pdb file, then click "submit molecule". Then there would be many files for many different MD softwares, download the GRO, TOP files of GROMACS and the LAMMPS file. 

Then you use the [convertLigParGen.py](https://github.com/mccg-pas/group-wiki/tree/master/Scripts/ILMD), which is a script written by [Michael Robinson](https://mccg.erc.monash.edu/group-members/). Following the information in the GitHub page, you can easily get the file containing the format of the parameters of OPLS-AA force field that can be used with the [fftool](https://github.com/agiliopadua/fftool) to produce LAMMPS input file.

For the details about how to use fftool to generate LAMMPS input file and data file, you can check this [fftool](https://github.com/agiliopadua/fftool) page. If you want to use the polarizable force field, you could check the tutorial of the [pol_il](https://github.com/kateryna-goloviznina/pol_il)page. Note that the [packmol](http://m3g.iqm.unicamp.br/packmol/home.shtml) program will be used to get an initial system. For more details of using packmol, you can check this [tutorial](http://sobereva.com/473).

Now you should be able to get the in.lmp and data.lmp, then you can change the information therein and run the simulation!
