Recently some people asked me how to make a picture of electrostatic potential map as shown in Figure 6 in my [2020 JACS paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c05643).
Although I think I could have made a more beautiful picture there... Some people are also interested in drawing the non-covalent interactions.

So the protocols I used for making them are tutorials written by Dr. Tian Lu, see [here](http://sobereva.com/443) and [here](http://sobereva.com/68). Although it's in Chinese but using Google translator can easily help the reading. Those are very detailed tutorials so I do not intend to add anything else here. Be sure to cite the papers mentioned in that tutorial properly. 

By the way, Dr. Tian Lu also has two videos showing the steps about plotting the electrostatic potential map and non-covalent interactions. You can check them via [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17b411F7mh) and [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1KE411y79i) respectively.

**I will leave a space here, so if anyone ask me related questions, here I can add more details which not included in those original tutorials.**

### Q1. How to tune the VMD color scale bar for ions?

For ions, if you use the default color scale bar, the ESP might be completely blue or red, so how to tune the color scale bar for ions?

In VMD, choose "Graphics" then choose "Representations", selected molecule, choose "0: density1.cub", in "Trajectory", change the color scale data range, the default one is -0.03 to 0.03, for cations, for example, we can change to 0.05 to 0.13. You can gradually tune the values to produce the best visulaization for you. Then click "set". Then choose "Extensions"--"visualization"--color scale bar. set the following options as: 

Display title: off

Autoscale: On

Use Molecule: 0: density1.cub

Use Representation: 1:isosurface

Label format: Decimal

Then click "Draw Color Scale Bar", it will appear on the VMD screen. You can change the mode, for example, changing "Rorate Mode" to "Translate Mode" and then move the color scale bar to the place you like.

### Here's an example of ESP for one of my current project
