Recently some people asked me how to make a picture of electrostatic potential map as shown in Figure 6 in my [2020 JACS paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c05643).
Although I think I could have made a more beautiful picture there... Some people are also interested in drawing the non-covalent interactions.

So the protocols I used for making them are tutorials written by Dr. Tian Lu, see [here](http://sobereva.com/443) and [here](http://sobereva.com/68). Although it's in Chinese but using Google translator can easily help the reading. Those are very detailed tutorials so I do not intend to add anything else here. Be sure to cite the papers mentioned in that tutorial properly. 

By the way, Dr. Tian Lu also has two videos showing the steps about plotting the electrostatic potential map and non-covalent interactions. You can check them via [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17b411F7mh) and [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1KE411y79i) respectively.

**I will leave a space here, so if anyone ask me related questions, here I can add more details which not included in those original tutorials.**

Here's an example of ESP for one of my current project
