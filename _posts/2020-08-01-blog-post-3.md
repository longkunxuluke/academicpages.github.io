Recently some people asked me how to make a picture of electrostatic potential map as shown in Figure 6 in my [2020 JACS paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c05643).
Although I think I could have made a more beautiful picture there...

So the protocol I used is a tutorial written by Dr. Tian Lu, see [here](http://sobereva.com/443). Although it's in Chinese but using Google translator can easily help the reading. That's a very detailed tutorial so I do not intend to add anything else here. Be sure to cite the papers mentioned in that tutorial properly. 

**I will leave a space here, so if anyone ask me related questions, here I can add more details which not included in that original tutorial.**

Here's an example of ESP for one of my current project
