My research is mainly about theoretical and computational chemistry. I develop and apply computational methods to study the effects of electrostatic environment on various chemical properties and reactions. I am particularly interested in the follwing topics:
## 1. Ordered solvent and ionic liquids; 
please learn more from my [2020 JACS paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c05643)

## 2. Improving the accuracy of implicit solvent models; 
please learn more from my [2019 JPCA paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.9b04920) and [2019 JCTC paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00888)

## 3. Non-equilibrium solvation and solvent reorganization; 
please learn more from my [2017 CPL paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000926141730427X)
