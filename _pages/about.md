My name is Longkun Xu, people also call me Luke. I am currently a PhD student in [Prof. Michelle Coote group](http://rsc.anu.edu.au/~mcoote/index.html). I was born in Taian, China in 1993. in 2015, I got my Bachelor's degree at Qingdao Agricultural University. Then I moved to Chengdu and did my Master's degree at Sichuan University. Before starting my PhD, I worked shortly as an assistant editor for the journal Materials at MDPI publisher in Beijing.

My research is mainly about theoretical and computational chemistry. I develop and apply computational methods to study the effects of electrostatic environment on various chemical properties and reactions. I am particularly interested in the follwing topics:
## 1. Ordered solvent and ionic liquids; 
please learn more from my [2020 JACS paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c05643)

## 2. Improving the accuracy of implicit solvent models; 
please learn more from my [2019 JPCA paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.9b04920) and [2019 JCTC paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00888)

## 3. Non-equilibrium solvation and solvent reorganization; 
please learn more from my [2017 CPL paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000926141730427X)
