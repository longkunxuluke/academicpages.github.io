## Research Interests

My research is mainly about theoretical and computational chemistry. I develop and apply computational methods to study the effects of electrostatic environment on various chemical properties and reactions. I am particularly interested in the follwing topics:

### 1. Ordered solvent and ionic liquids; 
please learn more from my [2020 JACS paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c05643)
