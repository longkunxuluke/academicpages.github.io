My name is Longkun Xu, people also call me Luke. I am currently a PhD student in [Prof. Michelle Coote group](http://rsc.anu.edu.au/~mcoote/index.html). I was born in Taian, China in 1993. 

2011 September-2015 July, Bachelor's degree (Material Chemistry), Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao, China

2015 September-2018 July, Master's degree (Applied Chemistry), Supervisor: Prof. Xiang-Yuan Li, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China

2018 July-2018 September, Assistant Editor ([Materials](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials), [High-Throughput](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/high-throughput)), MDPI publisher, Beijing, China

2018 October-present, PhD student (Chemistry), Supervisor: Prof. Michelle Coote, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia

My research is mainly about theoretical and computational chemistry. I develop and apply computational methods to study the effects of electrostatic environment on various chemical properties and reactions. I am particularly interested in the follwing topics:
## 1. Ordered solvent and ionic liquids; 
please learn more from my [2020 JACS paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c05643)

## 2. Improving the accuracy of implicit solvent models; 
please learn more from my [2019 JPCA paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.9b04920) and [2019 JCTC paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00888)
